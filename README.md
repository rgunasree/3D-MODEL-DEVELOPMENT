# 3D Model Development Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a 3D model using the PIFuHD algorithm. The project uses a combination of Python scripts and shell commands to clone the PIFuHD repository, install required packages, and run the algorithm to generate a 3D model from a given image.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* SciPy
* trimesh

## Installation

1. Clone the PIFuHD repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pifuhd

2. Install the required libraries:
!pip install rembg opencv-python-headless torch numpy trimesh
!wget https://download.01.org/opencv/openvino_training_extensions/models/human_pose_estimation/checkpoint_iter_370000.pth

## Usage

1. Upload the image: Upload the image file you want to process.
2. Process the image: Use rembg to remove the background.
3. Run the pose estimation and 3D reconstruction: Use PIFuHD to generate a 3D model.

## Output
The generated 3D model will be saved in the PIFuHD results directory. You can view the model using the trimesh library.
